<!--D3 and indeed most of data visualization tools are founded upon what are called SVG's. So SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. And SVG is a family of specifications for creating vector graphics. Since vector graphics are not created out of pixels they can be scaled up to larger or smaller sizes without losing image quality. SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML format. Now remember XML is a superset of HTML and the (Document Object Model)DOM includes XML as part of its specification. You can use the DOM tree to access and update the structure content and the style of SVG images. Also you can target SVG using Cascading Style sheets (CSS).-->

    <!--let's try another shape let's try a polygon and a polygon relies on a number of points to map out its boundary and by default all the points will be filled in to represent a solid shape adding some points in here now remember in 2d graphics a point is made up of an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate obviously in 3d graphics it's made of an x-coordinate a y-coordinate and a z-coordinate or a Z coordinate here we can see our polygons all the points are represented and there's a fill from the origin of the Y and the x-axis out as far as they outermost point.
        <polygon points="0,0 100,0 200,100 250,50 300,300 0,300"

    Let's play around with the rectangle again got it said its X&Y coordinates to 0 which means the top left-hand corner of our SVG viewport unlike the plane that you would have learned in school the Cartesian plane you had learned in school in computer graphics by default the origin is the top left hand corner. -->

    <!--So we've defined a single rectangle let's copy and paste this shape a few times and that's changed the x coordinate let's increase it by 20 each time what we're going to do is create a series of bars moving from left to right yes we rendered each bar is 20 pixels out further than the last and each bar is only 19 pixels wide that's why you get to see the separators now let's change the heights for these save render bar chart or histogram but it's upside-down that's because in computing the origin is on the top left-hand corner of the two-dimensional plane but we can fix this and later when we get to d3 there are functions that will do that automatically for us so that our bar charts appear the right way up. So what we're doing here is we're changing the y-coordinate so the rendering will begin at different points on the y-axis moving down the screen and there you get a more recognizable bar chart you can see here that this forms the basics of data visualizations once we become familiar with the SVG we will start working with data at the moment these values are hard-coded into each rectangle object within the SVG viewport in later units we'll start working with external data in order to provide that which is a much more realistic representation of data visualizations and how they work. But before we finish let's change the color of each of these bars, to make the differences and the values stand out that little bit more. So there you have it, scalable vector graphics using a viewport, it's child elements are basic shapes and they can be built upon and customized. -->

    <h3>Rectangle</h3>
    
    <!--As you can see on the screen you create an SVG, just as you would any other HTML element. So it has an opening tag and a closing tag. Now the area in between the opening and closing tag is called a viewport And in that viewport you can define child elements, which are shapes such as rectangles, circles ellipses, polygons, paths, texts and more. In our example we are creating a rectangle, and just like any other HTML element it too has attributes - it has x and y coordinates which determine where it's drawn on the screen it also has a width and a height. Also notice that by default the color of the graphic will be black just like text rendered in black by default.-->

        <!--<rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="50"  fill="red"/>-->
    <!--Let's define a circle now. A circle has a C X and a C Y value which define the center of the circle so it's x and coordinate at the center you also define a radius in our example we're setting our x value for the circle to be a hundred pixels out from the left of the viewport and 25 pixels down from the top of the viewport our radius is also equal to 20. Let's change the color by adding a filter to our rectangle and let's give it a color red and let's give the circle a color of blue.  Render them again and you can see that the circle overlays the rectangle that's because it is rendered after the rectangle-->              
        <!--<circle cx="100"  cy="25" r="20" fill="blue"/>-->

    <!--<svg>
        <!--<circle cx="100"  cy="25" r="20" fill="blue"/>
    <!--Let's swap those around refresh the browser and you can see that the rectangle now overlays the circle that's because the rectangle appears after the circle in this case.  -->
